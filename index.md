## About Me
I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at J. J. Strossmayer University of Osijek, Croatia, with [Prof. Zoran TomljanoviÄ‡](https://www.mathos.unios.hr/index.php/kadrovi/nastavnici-i-suradnici/26-homepage/odjel/kadrovi/homepages/119-zoran-tomljanovic-s-home-page). I obtained my PhD from the Department of [Mathematics](https://www.iitg.ac.in/maths), [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in) under the supervision of [Prof. Rafikul Alam](https://www.iitg.ac.in/rafik/) in 2019. From October 2020 to October 2021, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at Deraprtment of [Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/old_web) working with [Prof. Harish. K. Pillai.](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/hp#contact_information)
